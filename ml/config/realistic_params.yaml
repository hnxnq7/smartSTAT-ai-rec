# Ordering Cadence by Category (days between order opportunities)

order_cadence_days:
  A: 7    # Weekly - stable demand allows optimization
  B: 14   # Biweekly - low volume
  C: 7    # Weekly - matches weekly pattern
  D: 7    # Weekly - need to react to trends
  E: 3    # Frequent - burst events require rapid response
